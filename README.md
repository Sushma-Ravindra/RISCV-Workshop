    RV-D1SKI Introduction to RISC V : Basic Keywords
 </summary>

## RV-D1SKI L1 Introduction 

ISA in layman terms is the language of the computers. If there is a code snippet that needs to be implemented on a harware, it has to be first converted to machine instructions furthermore into binary format. The higher level program(c) will be converted to an RTL and then subsequently mapped onto the hardware. An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software. The ISA acts as an interface between the hardware and the software, specifying both what the processor is capable of doing as well as how it gets done.


## RV_D1SK1_L2_From Apps To Hardware

Even the apps that are used so widely, are ultimately run on a hardware. This is done with the help of an intermidiate system called **system software** . It comprises of OS, kernel,compilers and assemblers.

_Compiler_: In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a low-level programming language (e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program ie exe file. 


_Assembler_ : An assembler is a type of computer program that takes in basic instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform basic operations. The assembler's job is to convert assembler or assembly language code into machine code that the computer can then read and execute.


_Architecture of the computer_ : So architecture or ISA is the abstract interface between higher languages and generated machine level instructions by the compiler.

Now, for the hardware to read instructions from the bit stream, there is need for RTL languages that further synthesis the instruction received from higher level languages into a netlist which can be implemented on the hardware.

## RV-D1SK2 - L1 - C Program to compute sum from 1 to N. 

Open a file named sum_1_to_n. using leafpad editor.
```
  $leafpad sum_1_to_n.c

```

Write your C code for sum of numbers from 1 to n (say n =9).
Compile using GNU compiler.
 ```
 $gcc sum_1_to_n.c

```

Run the compiled object file (Default object file formed with the name a.out). 

```
  $./a/out

```

## RV-D1SK2 - L2 - C - GCC Compile and Disassemble.

Since we have previously created our sum_1_to_n.c program file, now to run the same program using RISC-V simulator:

```
$riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1_to_n.o sum_1_to_n.c

```
Command info: riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc => RISC-V compiler , -Ofast => Compiler option (Various compiler options like -O1, -o1, -Ofast) , -mabi=lp64 => ABI of long int pointer , -march=rv64i => architecture-64bit , -o => output , sum_1_to_n.o => object file , sum_1_to_n.c => C program file

In order to see what is the assembly code for the C program that is run ,i.e to see the disassembled file, run the following in a new tab in the terminal:
```
$riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1_to_n.o | less

```

The same C program is now compiled using RISC-V toolchain. Spike simulator is used to run the object file , and also as a debugger.
```
  $ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
  $ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
  # different command 
  $ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
  $ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
  $ spike pk sum1ton.o
```

## RV-D1SK2 - L3 - Spike Simulation and Debug.


Some data representation terms we use:
Byte - A byte is a fundamental unit of digital information that consists of a group of eight bits.
Word - A word is a basic unit of data that a processor can operate on in a single instruction. It typically corresponds to the natural data width of the processor's architecture. In RISC-V Word is of length 32bits.
Double Word - In computer architecture and data representation, a "double word" is a term used to describe a unit of data that is twice the size of a "word." In RISC-V Double word is of length 64bits.
Most Significant bit(MSB) - MSB stands for "Most Significant Bit." It is a term used in digital systems and binary representation to refer to the bit in a binary number that holds the highest positional value.
Least Significant bit(LSB) - LSB stands for "Least Significant Bit." It is the term used in binary representation to refer to the bit in a binary number that holds the lowest positional value. In other words, the Least Significant Bit is the rightmost bit in a binary representation.

The total unsigned numbers we can form using n-bits is given as : 2^(n) - 1.
We use 2's complement representation to represent the negative numbers.
For signed representation, the MSB bit indicated the sign of the number. If MSB=0, it is a positive number and MSB=1 indicates a negative number.



    In signed representation of binary numbers, the range of positive numbers we can represent using n-bits is: 0 to (2^(n-1) - 1) and the range of negative numbers is: -1 to -2^(n-1).

## RV-D1SK3 - L2 - 64 bit Number System for Signed Numbers
 

In signed representation of binary numbers, the range of positive numbers we can represent using n-bits is: 0 to (2^(n-1) - 1) and the range of negative numbers is: -1 to -2^(n-1).
2's complement The two's complement is a mathematical technique used in computing to represent signed integers (positive and negative whole numbers) using the binary number system.

To convert a negative integer to its two's complement representation:
Take the positive binary representation.
Flip all the bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).
Add 1 to the resulting value.
Positive number MSB=0 Negative number MSB=1

## RV-D1SK3 - L3 - Lab for Signed and Unsigned Numbers


Let us do a lab exercise based on the signed and unsigned binary numbers:

 The following code is to rpresent the highest binary number in unsigned representation:

```
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <math.h>
  int main() {
  unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int) (pow(2,64) -1);
  printf("highest number represented by unsigned long long int is %llu\n", max);
  return 0;
  }
```

Output:

Modifying the above program to check whether the result we got is the highest number are not:

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main() {
	long long int max = (long long int) (pow(2,10) * -1);
	printf("highest number represented by long long int is %lld\n", max);
	return 0;
}

```
Output:

Now, Create a new file signedHighest.c with the following code in it:
```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main() {
	long long int max = (long long int) (pow(2,63) -1);
	long long int min = (long long int) (pow(2,63) * -1);
	printf("highest number represented by long long int is %lld\n", max);
  printf("lowest number represented by long long int is %lld\n", min);
	return 0;
}
```
Output:

## DAY-2 - Introduction to ABI and Basic Verification Flow

 <summary>
    RV-D2SK1 - Application Binary Interface
 </summary>



Application Binary Interface - In the context of RISC-V, the ABI specifies how system calls are invoked and how data is passed between user-mode applications and the operating system. Specifically, the ABI defines which registers are used for passing parameters to system calls and for receiving return values. It also specifies how the system call number (which corresponds to the specific service being requested) is passed to the operating system.
Register Width in RISC-V - The width of registers in the RISC-V architecture is determined by the value of XLEN, which represents the native word size of the processor. XLEN is defined at the time the RISC-V architecture is implemented and can be different for different variations of the architecture.
![image](https://github.com/Sushma-Ravindra/RISCV-Workshop/assets/141133883/92a0b9f5-73db-43a9-8362-7e9025139f04)


For RV64 (RISC-V 64-bit architecture), XLEN is 64 bits. This means that general-purpose registers and other data paths in the processor are 64 bits wide.
For RV32 (RISC-V 32-bit architecture), XLEN is 32 bits. In this case, general-purpose registers and data paths are 32 bits wide.

Registers - In RISC-V there are 32 registers(x1-x31). We can load the registers in two different ways.

Load directly into the registers.
Load into the memory and then to register.(Each memory cell hold 1byte for 64bits data to load into memory we need 8 such memory cells)

Little-endian memory addressing system - RISC-V belongs to the little endian memory addressing system.In a little-endian system, the least significant byte (LSB) of a multi-byte value is stored at the lowest memory address, while the most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the highest memory address.



Application Binary Interface:

It is a mode through which the application programmer can access the contents of hardware resources of the processor. The access of porcessor is done via registers.
In RISC-V specification, we have 32 registers whose width is defined by the keyword "XLEN". It is XLEN-32 bit for Rv32 and XLEN-64 for Rv64.
For RV64, the data can either be loaded to registers directly or we can first load tha data into memory which holds 8-bits in each memory address and then transfer it to the registers.
All the instructions in RISC-V is of 32-bits.
    1.ld(load doubleword) is a command to load the contents of memory into register.
    2.add is used to add the contents of the registers/memory.
    3.sd(store doubleword) is used to store the contents of register back to the memory.

In the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), instructions are categorized based on their formats and functionalities. The I-type, R-type, and S-type instructions are three common categories of instructions in RISC-V. These categories help describe the structure of the instruction and how they operate on data.

    I-Type Instructions (Immediate): I-type instructions are used for operations that involve an immediate value (constant) and a register. The immediate value is encoded within the instruction itself. Common examples include ADDI (add immediate), LW (load word), and SW (store word). Syntax: OP rd, rs1, imm

    R-Type Instructions (Register): R-type instructions are used for operations that involve registers. The operation is specified by the opcode, and both source registers and destination registers are used. Common examples include ADD (add), SUB (subtract), and AND (bitwise AND). Syntax: OP rd, rs1, rs2

    S-Type Instructions (Store): S-type instructions are used for storing data from a register into memory. They involve two registers and an offset that determines the memory location. Common examples include SW (store word) and SH (store halfword). Syntax: OP rs2, imm(rs1) Registers As we can see in the above figure 5bits are needed to represent each register. So if we calculate total number of registers we can have it will be, 2^5=32. Different types of registers is shown above.

    RV-D2SK2 - Labworks using ABI function calls
 </summary>














Using ASM(Assembly language program) we are writing the code for sum of numbers from 1 to 9. We have main program in 1to9_custom.c file which does the function call and the function get calls in load.

```
#include<stdio.h>
extern int load(int x,int y); //defined function over here

int main{
int result=0;
int count=9;
result = load(0x0, count+1);

printf("sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n", count,result);
}


//load.S
.section .text	
.global load
.type load, @function

load: 
	add  a4, a0, 0
	add  a2, a1, 0
	add  a3, 0, 0
loop:
	add  a4, a4, a3
	add  a3, a3, 1
	blt  a3, a2, loop
	add  a0, a4, 0
	ret

```

Run the above codes using spike compiler and observe:
